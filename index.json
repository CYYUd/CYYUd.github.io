The only one day in Astria was dedicated to Hallstatt. Hallstatt, known as the most beautiful town in the world, declared as one of the World Heritage Sites in Austria. Strolling the street in such a beautiful town, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t even believe the wonder land was existed. The colorful houses built at the foot of mountain and facing the sparkling \u0026ldquo;Hallstätter See\u0026rdquo;, with swans swimming leisurely on the lake. With this fascinating scenery, you will realize that why Hallstatt can be the must-go town in the rest of life. However, it\u0026rsquo;s a little bit pity that the church was under renovation as shown in the photo.\n","permalink":"https://CYYUd.github.io/blog/0701journy/","tags":["Photos","React"],"title":"0701 Journey in Europe - Hallstatt"},{"categories":["Mood"],"contents":"It the end of the long holiday. I\u0026rsquo;ve travel to Yilan at 6/26 to 6/27 with my family. It really precious that the whole family were arrived. I can\u0026rsquo;t really remember the last time we have the travel with entire family members. We went hiking at Fushan Botanical Garden, known as the conservation area of many plant and animal species. The secenery was picturesque and really give me a good refreshing of my mind. It seems that i need to close to nature more after i\u0026rsquo;ve become the worker. To temporarily get away from the disturbance and stress from work is really important to me. However, the more importantly was to enjoy the peace and joy with family. It gave me strength to face the following difficulty and suffering. I\u0026rsquo;ll keep my chin up and keep work hard to develope myself.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the song I\u0026rsquo;ve listening recently.

Attending to company at 8:30 a.m. and getting off work around 8~9 p.m. with a exhausted body, I\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking about my life a lot recntly. To be honestly, i don\u0026rsquo;t really want my live become so confined. Seems that if i leave the world some day, nobody would found and care about. It is inedeed not the life-type i wanted. Therefore, i want to swear to myself. Eventhough the exhausting job, i still have to exploring new things, new knowledge and improve myself. Keep learning and don\u0026rsquo;t waste time though it hard and tough. But at least i\u0026rsquo;ve tried and struggle to make my life more colorful and more hopeful. I must write 1 post of my blog a week, including mood, investment, language, music, reading, etc. Before my lungs give out, it\u0026rsquo;s too early to feel like a faliure.\nModern Loneliness, the song I listen to the most recently.

I\u0026rsquo;ve traveled to Europe last Septemper just after i got my master degree in Institute of Electronics.\nKönigssee, located at southeast of Germany, known as the most claer and famous lake, formed by the glacier in the Ice age. The emerald water is even drinkable. We took the boat from Abfahrt der Boote to Salet and hike around the Obersee. Then went back to St. Bartholomä. The scenery along the way was fantastic, made me away from the disturbance in reality. It\u0026rsquo;s recommended to sit on the right side when taking the boat. You can see the \u0026ldquo;sleeping witch\u0026rdquo; and hear the \u0026ldquo;echo performance\u0026rdquo; because of the surrounding sheer rock walls. In addition, you can see the St. Bartholomä with its famous red, onion-shaped roof. Every single part in there is charming whether the scenery of mountains and lakes. It seems your mind were cleand in such the fairyland. Königssee is definately the must-go place in the rest of your life!\nThe St. Bartholomä\n  ","permalink":"https://CYYUd.github.io/blog/0617journey/","tags":["Photos","React","New"],"title":"0617 Journey in Europe - Königssee "}]
