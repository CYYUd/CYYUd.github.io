[{"categories":["My mood"],"contents":"It\u0026rsquo;s a Sunday night again, means i have to go to work tomorrow. lives become so fixed when i became an engineer. Attending to company at 8:30 a.m. and getting off work around 8~9 p.m. with a exhausted body, I\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking about my life a lot recntly. To be honestly, i don\u0026rsquo;t really want my live become so confined. Seems that if i leave the world some day, nobody would found and care about. It is inedeed not the life-type i wanted. Therefore, i want to swear to myself. Eventhough the exhausting job, i still have to exploring new things, new knowledge and improve myself. Keep learning and don\u0026rsquo;t waste time though it hard and tough. But at least i\u0026rsquo;ve tried and struggle to make my life more colorful and more hopeful. I must write 2 post of my blog a week, including mood, investment, language, music, reading, etc. Before my lungs give out, it\u0026rsquo;s too early to feel like a faliure.\nModern Loneliness, the song i listen to the most recently. It\u0026rsquo;s close to my mood right now, feeling so empty, lonely, and depressed. However, i\u0026rsquo;ll keep fighting to make my live better.\nYoutube video     ","permalink":"https://CYYUd.github.io/blog/diary0614-mood/","tags":["Photos","React","New","Mood"],"title":"My diary 0614"},{"categories":["Travel"],"contents":"Königssee The beautiful picture of lake remind me that there was a good old day i\u0026rsquo;ve enjoyed.
